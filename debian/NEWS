openbsd-inetd (0.20221205-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * When just "tcp" or "udp" is specified in inetd.conf, now inetd defaults
    to runnning two servers: one for IPv4 and one for IPv6 traffic.
    This is identical to specifying both e.g. "tcp4" and "tcp6".
    The old semantics of only accepting IPv4 connections can be restored
    by using "tcp4" or "udp4".
