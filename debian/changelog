openbsd-inetd (0.20221205-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New CVS snapshot.
  * When just "tcp" or "udp" is specified in inetd.conf, now inetd defaults
    to runnning two servers: one for IPv4 and one for IPv6 traffic.
    This is identical to specifying both e.g. "tcp4" and "tcp6".
    The old semantics of only accepting IPv4 connections can be restored
    by using "tcp4" or "udp4".
  * Added the missing echo and chargen TCP small services to the example
    inetd.conf. No examples for other UDP small services will be provided
    because they are a source of reflection DoS attacks. (Closes: #1013300)
  * Added an autopkgtest.

openbsd-inetd (0.20080125-2) unstable; urgency=high

openbsd-inetd (0.20080125-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New CVS snapshot.
  * Package painfully converted to quilt.
  * Fixed a typo in debian/control. (Closes: #125181)
  * Fixed a typo in the init script. (Closes: #465613, #465732)

    (Closes: #416010)
  * Do not use log_warning_msg in the init script when inetd.conf is emtpy,
    this is not something deserving extra attention. (Closes: #435658)
  * Document in inetd(8) that datagram services must read some network
    input or inetd will continue spawning them.
    Many thanks to James Cameron for the analysis. (Closes: #436803)
  * Use a real characters class instead of character ranges with grep
    in the init script, because some locales have weird ranges.

openbsd-inetd (0.20050402-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Try again to fix #386469 by stopping the daemon in postinst before
    starting it, because update-inetd run by the maintainer script of a
    different package may have restarted it after the prerm ran on upgrade.
    Patch courtesy of Steve Langasek. (Closes: #386469)

  * Try again to fix #386469, this time by removing from the init script

    to be broken and generally a bad idea.

openbsd-inetd (0.20040915-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New CVS snapshot.
    + Fixes gcc 4.0 FTBFS. (Closes: #287860)
  * Made the init script source /etc/default/openbsd-inetd, if present.
    (Closes: #251224)
  * Documented in inetd(8) that switching between binding to INADDR_ANY and
    to a specific address requires restarting the daemon. (Closes: #242392)
  * Added code to create the requested type of IPv6 socket using
    setsockopt(IPPROTO_IPV6). This requires a modern 2.4 or 2.6 kernel.
  * Added Conflicts+Replaces+Provides: netkit-inetd to fully replace it.
    prerm will unlink netkit-inetd's conffiles and the init script is
    named openbsd-inetd to allow purging netkit-inetd.
    Alternative solutions to both issues are welcome.
  * Changed the default inetd.conf to satisfy people who think that every
    listening socket is a security hole: no internal services are enabled
    by default. This means that the daemon will not even be started by the
    init script until some service is enabled in inetd.conf.
  * Removed from the default inetd.conf the already-commented examples
    of the internal services which are actually dangerous to run.
